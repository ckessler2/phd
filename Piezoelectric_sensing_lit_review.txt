P3: Studies were also prone to bias because of the small sample size and imbalanced class
size - cant really solve that can we

Need to improve the current wearable technology - maybe? Wireless method? (P1: PFG)

Need for a standardized assessment protocol that could account for swallowing, dry swallowing, and non-swallowing tasks
	
P4: Algorithmic detection of swallowing from electromyographic signal

Demand for an autodetection program that identifies the swallowing patterns frommultiple sensors?




My concern: PESs are sensitive to many things: pressure, acceleration, temperature, strain, and force
	How to filter out unwanted signals?
Other variables 
	Tensing/relaxing neck muscles
	Tilting head

Could use FT to visualise swallow signal, maybe ML to recognise it?
