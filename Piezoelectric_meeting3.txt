Creating dataset, I think it will propbably work

Main issues are:
	Number of images (64 swallow, 300ish other)
	Noise (used matlab denoise, but still not great)

I think it shouldn't be too hard or impressive to train since dataset is small
Hyoid results look clearer to my eye - maybe we should stick to that?


If it doesn't immediately work, I will play with image processing, more classes
