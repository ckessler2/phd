rgb for position (figure 5)
same size subplot figures for vel / acceleration
missing mean + error bars shaded
y labels in scientific notation
daniele will send script + data monday/tuesday
remove redundant time ticks


adress comments in coefficients optimisation

1 more than x trajectories
add more references
2 list coefficients
3 plot lijfm 9 (li, ranges, final)
justify range of CR
add references relevant to heuristic search
	check data processing to see idea
	Matlab functions can be referred to

maybe table 3 title could be better

flip scatter plot

optimised coefficients
	explain parameters better
	show andersen results - coefficients were not exact, but parameters were very similar
	state how close they are
	references (andersen for validation)

comparison
	list inputs  of heuristic search used to calculate nondimensionals
	describe results in fig 9

figure 8 
	axis labels similar to text
	get rid of redundant tick marks (axes are all the same)
	fix z symbol (same as before)

figure 9
	flip around to make axes p+ ltr
	Put legend separate to plot - ALL TEXT SIMILAR SIZE TO TEXT
	make color scheme similar (rgbk)
