Open NRF Connect
Launch quick start app, then under develop, launch VS Code (can't just launch from desktop)
Or (maybe) open VScode, click NRF on left bar, then dots next to project, start new terminal. 
Check if west command is recognised

I am having issues running code (or even connecting to) a MCU - specifically an eyshsnzwz plugged into an j-link edu mini. I have verified with a multimeter that the PCB upon which the MCU is recieving power (VDD to GND is 3V). I have also connected 10 kOhm between Reset/IO and VDD, so now Reset/IO/CLK read 3V, 3V, and 0.4V, which is correct (I think). How should I go about talking to the board ?
