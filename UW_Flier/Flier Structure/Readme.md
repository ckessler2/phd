**How to build an Alsomitra Microflier**
---
**Required materials and tools:**
* 3.6mm mylar sheet
* 0.25mm diameter carbon rod
* Clue (BSI maxi-cure extra thick)
  
* Structural jig & 14 alignment washers (3D printed plastic)
* 14 Alignment pins (1.6mm)

**Manufacturing steps:**
1. Prepare materials - laser cut flier base from mylar (Flier_Base.dxf), cut rod to a length of 30.4 cm
2. Prepare tools - ensure pins fit snugly into jig (Jig.stl), and that washers (Jig_Washers.stl) fit snugly onto pins. If not, bore out jig and washers to fit
3. Assemble materials in jig - fit pins into jig, base onto jig through pins, and washers onto pins (as far down as possible).
4. Align rod - carefully bend rod (it is fragile) until it sits on one side, and gently push from the other side until it lays corrrectly along the entire front edge. Ensure the rod sits on top of the base, but not under any washers
5. Glue rod to base - using a thin wire or stick, place small amounts of glue around and along the length of the rod and flier edge. Ideally do not glue anything to the washers or jig - this will make removal difficult
6. Wait for glue to set, at least 3 hours
7. Remove flier - carefully remove washers and lift flier out. If necessary break tabs around each pin, and trim the edge clean.
