INTRO

FORMALISATION SECTION
	Reachable sets need to be explained. Explain how normalisation is not available in CORA


New Vehicle Specs

NEW RESULTS

	New vehicle results
	New Reachability plots 	Bare minimum already
	New Lipschitz Plots
	
Clarify Contributions Somewhere
	strengthen use of equations + snippets as contribution
	emphasize difficulty in formalisation 

Fix normalisation stuff, still an issue but solved for my results

Note that alsomitra application is basically quad, but more complex

From engineering perspective, what does NNCS do and why is it interesting?
How is it different to verification perspective




APPENDIX
	onnx script 1	
	onnx script 2

MAYBE?


Supplementary video?

Li model implemented in website would be sick, could be supplementary

Demonstrate complexity of equations compared to quad


Easter weekend

Parents + CeliaJoe arrive on thursday, spend night at Jason's
	Need keys from me, I need to ask stan
	Also get stanage book, maybe rope?

Leave Friday morning, back when?
