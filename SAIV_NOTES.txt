WHAT IS A SMT SOLVER, MARKOV CHAIN


same size subplot figures for vel / acceleration
missing mean + error bars shaded
y labels in scientific notation
daniele will send script + data monday/tuesday
remove redundant time ticks


adress comments in coefficients optimisation


add more references

3 plot lijfm 9 (li, ranges, final)
justify range of CR
add references relevant to heuristic search
	check data processing to see idea
	Matlab functions can be referred to

maybe table 3 title could be better

flip scatter plot

optimised coefficients
	explain parameters better
	show andersen results - coefficients were not exact, but parameters were very similar
	state how close they are
	references (andersen for validation)

comparison
	list inputs  of heuristic search used to calculate nondimensionals
	describe results in fig 9


speed is in supplementary
