1. **Intro**<br>
    Contributions:<br>
    1. Introduction of new case study<br>
       First results of formalisation & verification, new robust training for regression, relational verification with vehicle, modifications to CORA pipeline
    2. Lessons learnt<br>
        Real-life use-cases like Alsomitra require multiple tools to match desired spec, some standard methods apply (adv training is effective but requires modification), relational verification has to be in place for verifying robustness, vehicle used to write specifications and declare normalisation

2. **Background**
    1. Control with NN components
    2. Alsomitra
    3. Verification tools
    4. Adv training for robust classification - definitions of robustness, classification v regression

3. **Verification Task**


4. **Robustness training**


5. **Vehicle**
     1. Global property specifications
     2. Local property specification (PLR)
     3. Results (Global and Local)

8. **CORA**
    1. Reachability specification
    2. Reachability results (plots and t/f table)
    
9. **Discussion**
    1. Limitations
    2. Conclusions
