# Reachability analysis of _Alsomitra Macrocarpa_ NNCS
 
This folder contains scripts for plotting the reachable area of a small bio-inspired gliding drone, actuated by changing the position of the center of mass (COM). The framework used is [POLAR-express](https://github.com/ChaoHuang2018/POLAR_Tool), and the method for training the neural network controller is outlined [here](https://github.com/ckessler2/phd/tree/main/Alsomitra_NNCS).
