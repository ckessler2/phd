# Reachability analysis of _Alsomitra Macrocarpa_ NNCS
 
This folder contains scripts for plotting the reachable area of a [neural network controlled bio-inspired gliding drone](https://github.com/ckessler2/phd/tree/main/Alsomitra_NNCS), actuated by changing the position of the center of mass. The framework used is [POLAR-express](https://github.com/ChaoHuang2018/POLAR_Tool).
